Today I chose generics, because I never actually tried this with Java. Other languages like
Python tend to allow this implicitly without explicitly having to define them. 
So I found this as an idea on how to do this.

So, I also found the naming conventions on Stack Overflow for refernce.
E - Element (used extensively by the Java Collections Framework)
K - Key
N - Number
T - Type
V - Value
S,U,V etc. - 2nd, 3rd, 4th types


I need to step away, but I will be back to work on this tomorrow!
