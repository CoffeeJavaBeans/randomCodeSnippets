 The other day, I couldn't finish the study I wanted to do with Generics, but also wound up wondering about double
 colon notation ::
 This geeksforgeeks article was super helpful to understand https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/double-colon-operator-in-java/

 So, it's called a method reference operator and they behave exactly like lambda functions.
 Lambad fucntion syntax: stream.forEach( s-> System.out.println(s));
 Method reference syntax: <Class name>::<method name>
